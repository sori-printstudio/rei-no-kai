                <div class="abouttitle">"REI / れい"</div> is a project by photographer Marnicq Roebben, dedicated to documenting modernist, postmodern, and metabolist architecture across Japan.
                It grew from his fascination with the country’s distinctive architectural landscape, and from the realization that many of the buildings he hoped to photograph had already been demolished or irrevocably altered.
                With limited information available online about several of these structures, Roebben set out to record and archive as many as possible, making both the Images and their accompanying details publicly accessible.

                In the aftermath of the Second World War, Japan’s architectural landscape became a blank slate—a tabula rasa from which new movements emerged.
                The Metabolists first rose to prominence, followed by the spread of Postmodern architecture throughout the islands.
                Repeatedly reshaped by natural disasters, the country’s continually shifting environment provided fertile ground for experimentation, renewal, and innovation.
                The project’s title, <div class="abouttitle">"REI / れい"</div>, meaning zero, reflects both the idea of the tabula rasa and Japan’s recurring need to rebuild from scratch.
                It also nods to the group of young architects who gathered around Kenzo Tange in the early 1950s, known as Rei-no-kai —“just that gathering”—with rei suggesting their perceived insignificance as a collective.

            <div class="column3">
                <div class="abouttitle">REI</div> explores the visual identity of (post-)modern architecture in Japan through Roebben’s photographic lens. The Images are purely documentary; they do not form a narrative.
                This intentional absence of storytelling underscores the project’s purpose: to record rather than to construct a conceptual framework.
            
                The sequence of photographs follows a geographic progression from north to south, tracing the outlines of Japan’s regions and prefectures.
                <br><br>
                Unfortunately, some of the buildings included in the project have already been demolished, and others face demolition in the near future.
                As a whole, this collection stands not only as a record of architectural works, but also as a reminder of the impermanence of the built environment and the enduring dialogue between Japan’s past, present, and future.
